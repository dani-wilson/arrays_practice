# How confident do I feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- So far, I feel good. I know there is so much more than what can be done than the basic content we are learning, but I feel like I am getting it.

# Is there any additional learning I need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- I think it would be useful for me to watch a video on the different types of methods that can be used when working with Arrays.

# What questions do I have about arrays?
- None that I know of at the moment. I'm sure some will hit me soon, but as for right now, I don't know what I don't know.
